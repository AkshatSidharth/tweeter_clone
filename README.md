## Installation
To access the application, you can use [this link](https://react-twitter-clone.herokuapp.com/). It is currently hosted on heroku's free hosting plan while it's being developed, so it may take a little bit of time to load for the first time. Alternatively, you can fork the repository and install it using `npm install`, and running `npm run dev` inside the api directory to access the application through the webpack dev-server (`cd api`, followed by `npm run dev` from the root directory.)
